# TouriMap

A web-based mobile application for tourist attractions all around the world. 

### Info
Ever been to a new city and didn’t know where to go first? This app will help you! 

The main part of the app is a map displaying the most famous tourist attraction close to the user’s location. You are able to click on the icons and a pop up will tell you more about each sight. It is also possible to filter the type of attractions and only show a part (like cultural, natural, etc.). Also you are able to see your own location on the map. 

Secondly thw app offers the possibility to save some places as favourites. It will be marked differently on the map and also it is possible to filter the map, showing for example only the favourites. The list of favourite places is saved locally in a file and thus will not be lost when the app is closed and opened again. 

The app works anywhere on the world. The necessary data is automatically downloaded from the web based on the user’s location.
